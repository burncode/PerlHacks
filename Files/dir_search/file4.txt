This is file number 4!
If you don't know, ask Facilities." So said Brenda Richards, administrative operations assistant, as she explained that the folks at Facilities and
                                Services can be the ones to turn to with any question about AU.
                                       Richards and her Facilities cohorts hosted an open house on March 20 to demonstrate the department's new Intranet website. Many months in
                                the planning, the website is designed to facilitate the myriad of duties performed by the department. Whether it be room or vehicle bookings,
                                questions about emergencies, security access or procedures on working after hours, the website eases the flow of information, while increasing the
                                department's efficiency.
                                       Facilities director Greg Wiens agrees: "We're pleased to have this information on the Intranet. People don't have to come down (to the office) to
                                do a booking; now they can do it online and we can easily track things and know immediately if there is a glitch."
                                       Richards notes that while they can still deal with requests over the phone, "the most efficient and prompt response will be via the website."
                                       A little known fact: Did you know that the most common AU injury is a paper cut?
