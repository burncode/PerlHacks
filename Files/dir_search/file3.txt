AU Central and the Tim Byrne Building enjoyed some quiet time on March 26 when the power was out for ninety minutes throughout the region.
                                Facilities director Greg Wiens and his staff had the situation at AU quickly under control.
                                       "All our backup systems worked," Greg said. All staff were on hand and were quick to respond to the situation, which initially appeared as
                                though it extended simply to downed electrical equipment.
                                       Things could have been more serious because Kathy Ponto and Amber Hango from the School of Business were in the elevator on the way to a
                                meeting. The two kept their cool and used the phone to contact people at the Computer Help Desk, gaining immediate assurance that help was on the
                                way. Their incarceration lasted for less than five minutes. 
                                       Gary was pleased with Facilities' response and summed up the situation: "It went very smoothly. On a grand scale of things, it was interesting
                                and no more than that, which speaks well to the quality of our staff." He pointed out that just 24 hours earlier Facilities staff had conducted
                                scheduled maintenance to the UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) for the main server room. In the event of a power interruption, the batteries are
                                used until the generator can kick in. Without this backup, very bad things can happen to computing services.
