                                Two days previously, AU's Occupational Health and Safety Committee had organized another lunchtime
                                learning experience. Guest speaker Dawn Green, co-ordinator for AMA's "Mission Possible at Work"
                                traffic safety program, pointed out that each year in Alberta there are an average of 97,000 collisions,
                                25,000 injuries, and 380 fatalities - and 90% of collisions are caused by driver error. To help combat this,
                                the AMA has implemented "Mission Possible at Work." Through the program, drivers are made aware of
                                the various factors that can cause impairment (including fatigue and emotional distress), along with
                                knowing how to be aware of road hazards that can lead to collisions. 
                                       Joyce Loxam, Coordinator of Staff Relations and Development, says the committee is gauging
                                interest in running the Mission Possible program at AU. Feedback can be sent to OHSC members
                                through the OHSC website.
