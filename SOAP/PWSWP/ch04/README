Chapter 4: Programming XML-RPC

These files should run without any special installation of the library that
was written for chapter 4 (the fortune-serving library). Note that two of
the files have had their names slightly changed:

meer2html-RPC::XML.pl is now meer2html-RPC__XML.pl
fortune-RPC::XML.pl is now fortune-RPC__XML.pl

These changes were to prevent the ":" characters from causing problems with
filesystems that consider them to be special characters.

The files here are (in order of example and presentation in the chapter):

meer2html-Frontier.pl (example 4-1, page 53)
XRFortune.pm (sidebar, page 57)
fortune-Frontier.pl (example 4-2, page 57)
meer2html-Lite.pl (example 4-3, page 59)
fortune-Lite.pl (example 4-4, page 64)
meer2html-RPC__XML.pl (example 4-5, page 68)
fortune-RPC__XML.pl (example 4-6, page 72)
