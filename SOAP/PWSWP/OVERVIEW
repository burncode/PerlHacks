This collection of files includes all the program code from the book,
"Programming Web Services with Perl". The files are divided by the chapter
in which they appeared as examples.

Please note that this does not lend itself well to running the examples
directly from within this file hierarchy. While most of the code from
chapters 3 and 4 rely only on the various toolkits and external libraries
from CPAN, the SOAP applications grow more and more complex. Please take
note of the README files in individual chapter sub-directories.

There are a wide range of CPAN modules that are used by these examples. The
most obvious of these are the ones related to XML-RPC and SOAP:

	LWP (libwww-perl)
	RPC::XML
	RPC::XMLSimple (see note below *)
	SOAP::Lite
	XML::Parser

Additional dependancies are identified in each chapter directory. In some
directories, a simple Makefile.PL is provided to aid in setting up libraries
either for use when running the examples locally, or for installation if so
desired.

As much as is possible, the names of the sample files match the names used
in the chapters and/or appendices. The README files in each chapter-specific
directory will indicate which files correspond to which examples in that
chapter, along with page references.

Thanks for your interest in our book and our sample code.

(* The RPC::XMLSimple package is the XML-RPC toolkit formerly known as
   Frontier::RPC. According to original author Ken MacLeod, the module's
   maintenance is now being handled by a new developer and the module is
   going to be re-released under the new name. Despite this, there had been
   no sign of the new version or the new name by the time the book had been
   released.)
