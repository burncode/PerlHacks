Chapter 7: Serving SOAP over HTTP

With the code in this chapter, things become a little more complex. The
examples in chapter 7 included several Perl classes with compound names
(such as WishListCustomer::SOAP). Because of this, the files are presented
in a directory hierarchy that makes it possible to run all of the executable
applications from within this directory.

However, looking ahead to the examples from chapter 8, many of those use some
of the classes defined here. Those applications will need some special care,
which will be addressed in the documentation in that chapter's directory.

The files below are listed in the order they appear within the chapter itself.
Some of the applications were not given names in the example headings, so
simple names have been assigned here. Note that the two server examples that
use the HTTP::Daemon class reference this fact in their names, but the "::"
sequence has been changed to "__" to avoid problems on filesystems that treat
colons specially.

WishListCustomer.pm (examples 7-1 and 7-2, pp. 142-144)
SoapExBook.pm (not listed in the text, used by WishListCustomer.pm)
SoapExUser.pm (not listed in the text, used by WishListCustomer.pm)
server-HTTP__Daemon-1.pl (example 7-3, page 146)
WishListCustomer/Daemon.pm (example 7-4, page 147)
WishListCustomer/SOAP.pm (example 7-5, page 150)
server-HTTP__Daemon-2.pl (example 7-6, page 151)
client-wishlist-1.pl (example 7-7, page 151)
WishListCustomer/Apache.pm (example 7-8, page 153)
WishListCustomer/SOAP2.pm (example 7-10, page 156)
client-wishlist-2.pl (example 7-11, page 157)
server-HTTP__Daemon-3.pl (not referenced as an example in the text, exists
                          as an example of using WishListCustomer::SOAP2)

The following files are also present in this directory, though they are never
referenced by name in the text:

Makefile.PL
csv2dbm
catalog.csv
users.csv

The Makefile.PL is a fairly simple Makefile generator that works with Perl's
MakeMaker system, something all users of CPAN modules should be familiar with.
It is designed to do two things: allow for installing the modules into a given
installation location (defaulting to wherever modules get installed on your
system), and to generate the DBM files for the book catalog and user info that
the modules SoapExUser.pm and SoapExBook.pm rely upon. The files catalog.csv
and users.csv are the data in a simple, comma-separated-value format. The
csv2dbm script is used to create DB_File databases from these files. There are
commands put into the Makefile that Makefile.PL generates to do this, with the
following commands:

	make users.db

	make catalog.db

The "make clean" and "make realclean" commands will remove the *.db files, in
addition to the usual list of deletions.

Much of the module code in this chapter is used by the examples in chapter 8,
so you may wish to consider using the Makefile.PL to install the *.pm files
into a location where they may be easily found by those applications. (Of
course, you can also refer to this directory with the -I switch to the perl
executable, if you prefer.)
