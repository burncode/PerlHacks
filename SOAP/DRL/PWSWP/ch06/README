Chapter 6: Programming SOAP

Some of the examples here were not included in Appendix D because of their
simplicity. They are here to use as a basis for exploring more of the SOAP
functionality available. Note that due to an oversight, they were referred to
by different names in the text, though they were meant to represent the same
application. The names are kept here, to be consistent with the text.

Some of the examples make use of additional CPAN modules:

	SOAP (the Developmentor package, only used for num2text.pl)
	XML::RSS

The files, with example/page references, are:

num2text.pl (example 6-1, page 115)
num2name.pl (example 6-4, page 120)
upj2rss.pl (example 6-5, page 122)
upj2rss2.pl -- is not from the book, but is a modified upj2rss.pl that extracts
               more information for each entry to add to the RSS.
cpan2upj.pl (example 6-6, page 134)
