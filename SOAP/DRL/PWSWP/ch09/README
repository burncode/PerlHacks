Chapter 9: Service Description with WSDL

The files in this directory are not executable applications. Rather, they are
the WSDL descriptions that were developed as a part of the chapter's
presentation of the material. They are included here both as basic WSDL
examples and as material to feed WSDL-related tools for the sake of testing
and experimentation.

useperlorg.wsdl

This is the description for the "use Perl;" journal system's SOAP interface.
The interface is still under development, so this description may not match
a future API. However, this is built on the basic Slashcode code-base
(http://www.slashcode.org) which means that other Slash-based journal systems
would (in theory) support the same API.


wishlist.wsdl

This is the description for the sample system built up in chapters 7 and 8.
